## Overview of Tasks

### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load and understand the dataset's shape (rows and columns).
- Identify and handle missing values.
- Perform data type conversions if necessary.
- Explore the distribution of the target variable "Aggregate rating" and check for any class imbalances.

### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
